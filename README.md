The project involves developing a server application that allows users to register using a unique username and password to authenticate themselves to the server and join the forum. The registration process should display the message "Registration successful" upon success, while incorrect credentials should result in the message "Please enter the correct username and/or password". Communication between the client and the server is encrypted using the RSA algorithm and a graphical user interface is used. In addition, the server application has password policies, such as password length and character type, which the client must adhere to during registration.
